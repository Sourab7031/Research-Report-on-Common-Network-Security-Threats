# Research Report on Common Network Security Threats

## Objective
To provide a detailed understanding of common network security threats, how they operate, their impacts, and how to mitigate them. The report focuses on:
- DoS (Denial of Service) Attacks
- MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) Attacks
- Spoofing Attacks

---

## 1. DoS (Denial of Service) Attacks

### What is it?
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to overwhelm a network, server, or service, making it inaccessible to legitimate users by flooding it with excessive traffic.

### How it Works
- Attackers send a large volume of requests or data to a target system.
- The system becomes overloaded and cannot respond to real user requests.

### Impact
- Disruption of services or websites.
- Loss of revenue and reputation.
- Increased infrastructure costs.

### Real-World Example
In 2016, the **Dyn DNS** provider was attacked using a massive DDoS (Distributed DoS) attack with IoT devices, disrupting access to major platforms like Twitter, Netflix, and GitHub.

### Prevention Measures
- Use firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
- Implement rate limiting and traffic filtering.
- Keep systems updated with security patches.
- Use cloud-based DDoS protection services (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS Shield).

## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

### What is it?
A MITM attack occurs when an attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.

### How it Works
- The attacker places themselves between the client and server.
- They can eavesdrop, steal data (e.g., login credentials), or alter messages.

### Impact
- Unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Identity theft and financial fraud.
- Loss of user trust.

### Real-World Example
**Evil Twin Attack**: In public Wi-Fi hotspots, attackers create fake access points with similar names to trick users and intercept their data.

### Prevention Measures
- Use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for encrypted communication.
- Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities.
- Use VPNs to encrypt internet traffic.
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).

## 3. Spoofing Attacks

### What is it?
Spoofing is a technique where an attacker impersonates another device, user, or system to gain unauthorized access to data or networks.

### Types of Spoofing
- **IP Spoofing**: Forging IP packets to hide the sender's identity.
- **Email Spoofing**: Sending emails with a forged sender address.
- **DNS Spoofing**: Redirecting a domain to a malicious IP address.

### Impact
- Spreading malware or phishing.
- Unauthorized access to networks.
- Data theft or manipulation.

### Real-World Example
**Email Spoofing** is commonly used in phishing attacks to trick users into providing login credentials or downloading malware.

### Prevention Measures
- Implement email authentication protocols: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
- Use DNSSEC to protect against DNS spoofing.
- Configure routers to block forged packets.
- Educate users on how to identify spoofed messages.

## Conclusion
Network security threats such as DoS, MITM, and Spoofing pose serious risks to organizations and users. Understanding how these attacks work and implementing proper preventive measures is essential to maintain data integrity, availability, and confidentiality.
